# Assignment for Intership

This project is an assignment for an Intership built using Android technologies. It includes two screens: `FoodInfo` and `Activity`, following the MVVM architecture pattern, Jetpack Compose for UI, and Hilt for Dependency Injection.

## Features
- **FoodInfo Screen**: Displays detailed information about a selected food item.
- **Activity Screen**: A general activity screen that handles user interactions and navigation.
  
## Architecture
- **MVVM**: Model-View-ViewModel architecture is used to separate concerns, ensuring a clear flow of data and logic between UI and business logic.
- **Jetpack Compose**: The UI is built using Jetpack Compose for a declarative UI approach.
- **Hilt**: Dependency Injection is handled using Hilt to manage app components' dependencies efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Hilt
- MVVM Architecture
- Android SDK

## Experience in Mobile App Development

As an Android developer, I have gained hands-on experience in building mobile applications using Kotlin and modern Android development tools. I've developed multiple apps following best practices, including clean architecture (MVVM), and focusing on scalability and maintainability. I enjoy building intuitive and responsive user interfaces using Jetpack Compose and implementing robust backend functionality with Hilt for dependency injection. This project specifically helped me strengthen my skills in structuring apps efficiently and writing clean, readable code.

## Good Practices Followed

In developing mobile applications, I follow these good practices to ensure high-quality, maintainable, and scalable code:

- **Clean Architecture**: I follow a layered architecture like MVVM, which separates concerns and improves code maintainability.
- **Modularization**: I break down the project into smaller, manageable modules, making it easier to test, maintain, and scale.
- **Dependency Injection**: I use Hilt to handle dependencies, ensuring a more flexible and testable codebase.
- **Code Reviews**: I regularly review and refactor code to keep it clean, optimized, and consistent.
